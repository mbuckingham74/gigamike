It came from Tzeitel who was talking to Jennette. I don’t want to say how I know but I absolutely do. I didn’t realize how jealous of Blue Tzeitel was until after Bend. She feared (initially denied but later confessed) that Blue was the ultimate threat to her. I talked about and missed Blue so much that she thought if I somehow got her back, I’d spend all my time and money on her instead of Tzeitel. Tzeitel would see Blue’s Tik Toks and Instagrams (she was obsessed, I set up the home network and could see Tzeitel checking many times a day, every day. She would tell me Blue has BPD/Schizophrenia and other stuff, along to “probably being a prostitute.” It was beyond disgusting and I am so embarrassed. Tzeitel did everything she could Includes lying about talking to you and saying that you said stuff about me that I know isn’t true) to get me to write Blue and you off. She and Jennette had an awful conversation about Blue and my mental health.   I do not like nor ever want to talk to Jennette again but I do not hold her kids in the same light (though they stole so much from me). Fern would steal but always confessed, apologized, cried and hugged me. I think it was compulsive and she couldn’t stop. Not sure, I’m easily manipulated. I also don’t think Blue and her make good choices together and before all this went down, my therapist and I resolved to do all I could to not let them be together unsupervised (which blew up in my face). I just want Blue to know that it absolutely did not come from Fern and I know Fern has an unhealthy obsession with Blue.   I made some very bad choices with people that were in my life and it cost me everything. It broke me that Blue was so hurt that she thought Fern said that about her when it was Jennette and why Jennette was so pissed at your for telling Blue. I am so, so sorry how this impacted Blue."

I work hard every day on the farm for $1,000 a month W-2 (not even minimum wage) and he hardly ever acknowledges me (Aaron is my boss). I’ve tried to do so many things with him and he never replies. I even got into guns (gave them up now) in a desperate attempt to see if he would want to do something with me. I came her broken, in desperate need of help and he just threw a corporate apartment at me and took control of my life with a POA/Conservatorship when I was vulnerable. I did the same thing with Tzeitel, I was vulnerable and let her take over for me (not in context of a relationship). I can sorta understand why a person like that would take advance of me but my parent is wild. He has all the power because he controls every dollar I have/get and I’m in his corporate housing unit which I could be asked to move at any moment.

Blue wasn’t upset at me for asking until she talked to Fern and then they got so defensive and angry about me “accusing” them. I don’t think I was wrong to ask or be worried, they both knew they were the only ones in my apartment in the two hours I was gone and the meds went missing. Fern at first tried to blame it on Cory but I asked how did Cory get there when Jennette was out with Elliot and couldn’t drive him there. Then Fern got upset at me “accusing” and talked to Blue. I can’t believe I lost my child over this."

I also was constantly recording to save my ass if the kids ever accused me of something. It was horrible, she didn’t want to be their mom and was just pawning them off on me. I was in a terrible spot. Listen to this one where I’m trying to be the mediator and discussing Fern’s fights with Tom and Jennette where they would say horrible things to each other. Please listen to just one and ask yourself if you think I would have said something like that to Blue. Sorry for all the text and will stop now. I hope you feel better."

You had me come over dozens of times to mediate when you guys were fighting and I ALWAYS took your side. Blue would always remind me that she stopped telling me how home life was “because you always take momma’s side”. What I really did was try to explain the nuances to her and remind her that she needs to respect her mom. This was totally normal in my mind, teenagers are hard to parent, especially when we are alone. I only had her every other weekend so never needed help until the one time I did and then I was discarded. Not only was I not backed up, but she got fed ugly stuff (and a lot distorted) about our relationship that only made it worse to give her fuel to hate me. I believe you that she just saw some stuff on your computer but some stuff I doubt you had written in a spreadsheet and you guys having to sleep on the streets of downtown Seattle for two years was outright untrue.   I have to be careful because you have all the power and able to gatekeep my access to Blue. That said, I have to be authentic, speak my truth and try to fight for her. We were co-parents until you decided not to be and I don’t know why."

You’re able to take advantage of my autism by saying I did something wrong and this works on me for a while but I did absolutely nothing wrong in worrying that she might have taken the ketamine especially after she and Fern had already stolen stuff a bunch and you had already found that box of drugs in the backyard.  I never brought up the ketamine after that Sunday so everything has to have been you. Blue also told me that you told her that I didn’t want to speak to her again which is false. You are triangulating both of us and that’s why you don’t want us to talk.  THere is no other explanation for your silence when I’m trying to do all the right things and satisfied your terms you specified to the court"

You said she saw a spreadsheet by accident and that’s where the stolen $176k came from but what about the stuff that happened in court? How did she find out about Monica? Why did she know so many details of my bike crash in October of 2009? These are all things that you told her to make her turn against me."

I learned that if I ever try to stand up for myself, you punish me as a way to try and control me.   The fact is though that your dad sexually abused our daughter on your watch for YEARS, you hid it from me (blaming me as the reason you couldn’t tell me). Blue nearly died of alcohol poisoning on your watch. You blamed me for the alcohol but the vodka came from Carolyn’s restaurant and I haven’t drank it many, many years.   She was buying drugs off Snapchat on your watch.  So how am I the bad parent when your family was hurting Blue and you had no idea she was drinking so much?  And I should lose her forever because I got worried she might have taken my ketamine?  No, that wasn’t the reason, it was the only thing you could use to justify taking the spotlight off you not being a mom for her."
