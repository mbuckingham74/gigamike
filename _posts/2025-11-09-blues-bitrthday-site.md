For Blue's birthday, I ordered a fancy, hardcover, quality photo paper book with pics from all of our memories and I made a slideshow with music we liked.

It broke me that neither she nor Amy would acknowledge and it was never visited. The second to the last time I talked to her, Blue told me that we never did anyting fun and she hated staying with me, just did it because Mama made her. She's an angry teenage girl, I get it and didn't say anything. But we had good times, SO MANY. I hope one day she'll remember.

Since I'm gone, this site will only last through April of 2016.
