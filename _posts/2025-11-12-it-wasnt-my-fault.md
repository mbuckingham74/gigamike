People would tell me all the time that it wasn't my fault that I was born neurodivergent. That is true but really irreleveant because it's my responsibility to heal and to fit into socient the way people want me to. 

I was a substandard kid that my parents didn't deserve and it was my responsibility to correct myself so I only did appropriate and acceptable things. I tried but if anything, only got worse at the end.

So it wasn't my fault but I didn't do a thing about it and becasme a burden to anyone who was unlucky enough to cross paths with me.
