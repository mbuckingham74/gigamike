People treated me the way I deserved and the outcome of my life accurately reflects that, they were absolutely right. What I can't reconcile is my own experience. I was told my all of my partners after Amy that I was extremely emotionally and physically abusive and destroyed a lot of property but I cannot, for the life of me remember any of this and I never saw any evidence. Why didn't they have me arrested? They say because they were so afraid of me but my brain tells me that I can only get angry at myself.

Then there was the very last day I saw Jennette. I was on a conference call with Kevin and Marcus at 7 am on a cold Monday morning in March. I hadn't talked to Jennette in several weeks and I was really surprised when I saw her come in the door (she had keys). My memory and what Kevin told me is that she yelled at me about something about Cory and threw the highball glass that Mia and Ky Ky were drinking from at my head. I remmber it exploding and blood everywhere so I ran into my bathroom where I took pics trying to make sure I had no glass in my eye. 

I came out of the bathroom and realized I needed to leav but she was blocking the front door. I slipped out the back and run to my car where I laid down. An hour later, the Black Diamond Police found me, took me to the hospital and arrested me for domestic violence. After I explained what I thought happened, I remembered I had security cameras set up in my kitchen that had a view of my entire apartment and confirmed my story. The cuffs were removed after they were able to confirm hours later and I went home the next day with just a concussion. 

To this day, I have ZERO idea what that was about and what she was angry about. I tried to talk to her later and she said I was being a "Michael, you were a fucking Monster, screaming at me and threatening me!" but that is so not me, I wouldn't scream in my apartment and both Marcus and Kevin said the only thing I did was turn around and say "Hi- good morning, is everything okay?" I certainly was not even remotely upset at her that morning or before that.

So what is the truth? Did I deserve that glass to the foreheard or was she mistaken and mad about something else? Chase, my friend at Black Diamond PD said I was lucky I had that video because she made a lot of claims about that morning that were not substantiated and he said it was curious that she said she was my girlfirend yet went out of her way to show that she didn't care if I was hurt or not and didn't want a follow up. 

Later at the hospital, I called her and after a few minutes, the nurse disconnected the line saying she was being extremely abusive to me and staff. I told them that she was probably just worried and scared about my injury which looked like a horror prop but people forget that the head bleeds extremely easily and is not a problem. 

So the one thing I can't reconcile is every one of my partners called me the abusive one but how come I'm the one that had no housing and lost all my belongings? Why was there never any discussion? I would just get kicked out or find out they said some really untrue things about me when I thought we were good. When I question it, even in a relaxed mannaer, I'm told I'm being abusive and scary. Not once, not once in any of my relationships was I able to bring a problem forward that had been bothing me without severe retribution. The exception was Amy, she wouldn't accuse me of anyting new but she coulg go up to a week without acknowledging me, even when I begged. She would say that the more I asked, the less likely she was to engage with me. I felt so invisible and worthless. 

The one pattern is that I would leave a relationship with nothing (my belongings held because I was so bad or something), shattered in a million pieces and they were in a relationship within a few days after I was kicked out. Jennette had moved on months before she kicked me out because she said I was so scary and she needed to find a man to defend her. I never once raised my voice at Jennette so this was always so confusing. She always had an answer for the things that hurt me the most, just like my dad. 

i'm not worthless but I do need to understand that they didn't do anything wrong, it's just that I'm annoying and they want me to leave. I was so unsure though, and would do the stupid thing and hang around until they were no longer mad about it and as long as I didn't bring up what was bothering me in the future.

I wish I could have figured out what it was that I was doing that made me ineligible for even basic compassion or understanding from anyone outside my mom or therapist. I think it's due to my autism.
