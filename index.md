# All Is Lost

I’m sorry. I know that means little at this point, but I am. I tried to be true, to be strong, to be kind. But I wasn’t. I failed you and I failed myself. I fought to the end. I’m sorry.

I had made an entire website with a bunch of writings but then I got smart and realized that nobody wanted to hear that, they just want to know that I'm no longer going to be a problem for them.

If you're reading this, it's because you meant a lot to me and I wish I could have been more for you, you deserved so much more than me. I may have stuck around lonnger in your life than you intended and I'm sorry for this, please know that it was not intentional.
